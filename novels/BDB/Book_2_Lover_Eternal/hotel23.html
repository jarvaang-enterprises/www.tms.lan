                                                               <p>
Bella popped open her oven, took a peek at dinner, and gave up the fight.<br>
<br>
What a mess.<br>
<br>
She grabbed a pair of pot holders and extracted the meat loaf. The poor thing had cowered away from the sides of the pan, blackened on top, and developed drying cracks. It was inedible, better suited to the construction supply trade than to a dinner plate. A few dozen more of these and some mortar and she'd have that wall she wanted around her terrace.<br>
<br>
As she shut the oven door with her hip, she could have sworn the high-end Viking stove was glaring at her. The animosity was mutual. When her brother had done over the farmhouse for her, he'd gotten her the best of everything, because that was the only way Rehvenge did things. The fact that she'd preferred the old-fashioned kitchen and the squeaky doors and the gentle aging of the place hadn't mattered. And God help her if she'd kicked up a fuss about the security measures. The only way Rehvenge had permitted her to move out was if he made her home fireproof, bulletproof, and impregnable as a museum.<br>
<br>
Ah, the joys of having a bossy brother with a lockdown mentality.<br>
<br>
She picked up the pan and was headed for the French doors to the backyard when the phone rang.<br>
<br>
As she answered, she hoped it wasn't Rehvenge. "Hello?"<br>
<br>
There was a pause. "Bella?"<br>
<br>
"Mary! I called you earlier today. Hold on a sec, I've got to feed the raccoons." She put the phone on the table, shot out to the yard, dumped the load and headed back in. When the pan was in the sink, she picked up the receiver. "How are you?"<br>
<br>
"Bella, I need to know something." The human's voice was strained.<br>
<br>
"Anything, Mary. What's wrong?"<br>
<br>
"Are you... one of them?"<br>
<br>
Bella sank down into a chair at her kitchen table. "You mean, am I different from you?"<br>
<br>
"Uh-huh."<br>
<br>
Bella glanced over at her fish tank. Everything always looked so calm in there, she thought.<br>
<br>
"Yes, Mary. Yes, I am different."<br>
<br>
There was a rush of breath on the line. "Oh, thank God."<br>
<br>
"Somehow, I didn't think knowing that would be a relief."<br>
<br>
"It is. I... I really have to talk to someone. I'm so confused."<br>
<br>
"Confused about..." Wait a minute. Why were they even having this conversation? "Mary, how do you know about us?"<br>
<br>
"Rhage told me. Well, showed me, too."<br>
<br>
"You mean he hasn't wiped... You remember him?"<br>
<br>
"I'm staying with him."<br>
<br>
"You're what?"<br>
<br>
"Here. At the house. With a bunch of men, vampires... God, that word..." The female cleared her throat. "I'm here with about five other guys just like him."<br>
<br>
Bella put her hand over her mouth. No one stayed with the Brotherhood. No one even knew where they lived. And this female was a human.<br>
<br>
"Mary, how did you... how did this happen?"<br>
<br>
When the story was all out, Bella was stunned.<br>
<br>
"Hello? Bella?"<br>
<br>
"Sorry, I... Are you okay?"<br>
<br>
"I think so. I'm all right now, at least. Listen, I have to know. Why did you put the two of us together? Rhage and me?"<br>
<br>
"He saw you and he... liked you. He promised me he wouldn't hurt you, which was the only reason I agreed to set you up on that date."<br>
<br>
"When did he see me?"<br>
<br>
"The night we took John to the training center. Or don't you remember that?"<br>
<br>
"No, I don't, but Rhage told me I'd gone there. Is John... a vampire?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, he is. His change is coming, which is why I got involved. He'll die unless one of our kind is with him when the transition hits. He needs a female to drink from."<br>
<br>
"So that night, when you met him, you knew."<br>
<br>
"I did." Bella chose her words carefully. "Mary, is the warrior treating you well? Is he... gentle with you?"<br>
<br>
"He's taking care of me. Protecting me. I have no idea why, though."<br>
<br>
Bella sighed, thinking she knew. Given the warrior's fixation on the human, he had probably bonded with her.<br>
<br>
"But I'll be home soon," the female said. "Just a couple of days."<br>
<br>
Bella wasn't so sure about that. Mary was so much deeper in their world than she realized.<br>
<br>
The smell of gas fumes was nasty, O thought as he maneuvered the Toro Dingo around in the dark.<br>
<br>
"That's good. We're good to go," U called out.<br>
<br>
O shut the thing off and surveyed the area he'd carved from the forest. Hat, about forty-by-forty-feet square, it was the layout of the persuasion building plus room for them to work.<br>
<br>
U stepped into the leveled area and addressed the assembled lessers. "Let's start getting the walls up. I want three sides raised. Leave one open." U motioned impatiently with his hand. "Come on. Move it."<br>
<br>
The men picked up frames made out of eight-foot-long two-by-fours and carried the things around.<br>
<br>
The sound of an approaching vehicle stopped everyone, though the lack of headlights suggested it was another lesser. With their superior night vision, Society members were able to dance around in the dark as if it were high noon; whoever was behind that wheel dodging trees had the same acuity.<br>
<br>
When Mr. X got out of the minivan, O went over.<br>
<br>
"Sensei," O said, bowing. He knew the bastard appreciated the respect and somehow pissing off the guy just wasn't as fun as it used to be.<br>
<br>
"Mr. O, it looks like you're making progress."<br>
<br>
"Let me show you what we're doing."<br>
<br>
They had to shout over the clapping of hammerheads, but there was no reason to worry about any of the noise. They were smack-dab in the middle of a seventy-five-acre plot of land about thirty minutes from Caldwell's downtown area. To the west of the property was a swamp that served as one of the Hudson River's flood zones. Covering the north and east was Big Notch Mountain, a pile of state-owned rock that climbers didn't favor because of its rattlesnake dens, and that tourists found all-around unappealing. The only point of exposure was from the south, but the rednecks who lived in the scattered, decaying farmhouses didn't seem like the type to wander.<br>
<br>
"This looks good," Mr. X said. "Now where are you putting in the storage facilities?"<br>
<br>
"Here." O stood over a section of ground. "We'll have the supplies in the morning. We should be ready to receive visitors in a day."<br>
<br>
"You've done pretty well, son."<br>
<br>
Goddamn it, O hated the son shit. He really did.<br>
<br>
"Thank you, sensei," he said.<br>
<br>
"Now walk me to my car." When they were a distance away from the work, Mr. X said, "Tell me something. Do you have much contact with the Betas?"<br>
<br>
O made sure their eye contact didn't waver. "Not really."<br>
<br>
"Have you seen any of them lately?"<br>
<br>
Christ, where was the Fore-lesser going with this? "No."<br>
<br>
"Not any time last night?"<br>
<br>
"No, like I said, I don't hang with the Betas." O frowned. He knew that if he demanded an explanation, he'd just look defensive, but fuck it. "What's this about?"<br>
<br>
"Those Betas we lost in the park last night had shown some promise. I'd hate to think you were slaughtering your competition."<br>
<br>
"A brother¡ª"<br>
<br>
"Yes, a member of the Brotherhood attacked them. Right. Funny, though, the brothers always make sure they stab their kills so the bodies disintegrate. But last night, those Betas were left for dead. And hurt badly enough so they couldn't really respond to questions when they were found by their backup squad. So no one knows what happened."<br>
<br>
"I wasn't in that park and you know it."<br>
<br>
"Do I?"<br>
<br>
"For chrissakes¡ª"<br>
<br>
"Watch your mouth. And watch yourself." Mr. X's pale eyes narrowed into slits. "You know who I'll call if I need to pull your choke chain again. Now get back to work. I'll see you and the other primes at first light for your check-in."<br>
<br>
"I thought that's why we had e-mail," O said through gritted teeth.<br>
<br>
"It's in person from now on for you and your team."<br>
<br>
When the minivan drove off, O stared into the night, listening to the cracking sounds of construction work. He should have been seething with anger. Instead he was just... tired.<br>
<br>
God, he had no enthusiasm left for this job of his. And he couldn't even get worked up over Mr. X's bullshit. The thrill was gone.<br>
<br>
Mary glanced at the digital clock: 1:56. Dawn was still hours and hours away, and sleep was out of the question. All she pictured when she closed her eyes were those weapons hanging off Rhage's body.<br>
<br>
She rolled over onto her back. The idea of not seeing him ever again was so disturbing, she refused to look into the feelings too closely. She just accepted them, bore them badly, and hoped for some relief.<br>
<br>
God, she wished she could go back to when he'd left. She would have hugged him hard. And given him a stiff lecture about staying safe even though she knew nothing about fighting and he was, hopefully, a master at it. She just wanted him safe¡ª<br>
<br>
Suddenly the door was unlocked. As it swung open, Rhage's blond hair gleamed in the light from the hall.<br>
<br>
Mary shot off the bed, crossed the room at a dead run, and threw herself at him.<br>
<br>
"Whoa, what the..." His arm went around her and picked her up, keeping her with him as he came through the door and shut it. When he released her, she slid down his body. "You all right?"<br>
<br>
As her feet hit the floor, she came back to reality.<br>
<br>
"Mary?"<br>
<br>
"Ah, yeah... yes, I'm okay." She stepped to the side. Looked around. Blushed like all hell. "I'm just... yeah, I'm just going to go back to bed now."<br>
<br>
"Hold up, female." Rhage took off his trench coat, the chest holster, and the belt. "Get back over here. I like the way you welcome me home."<br>
<br>
He opened his arms wide and she went into them, holding on hard, feeling him breathe. His body was so warm and he smelled wonderful, like fresh air and good clean sweat.<br>
<br>
"I didn't expect you to be up," he murmured, running his hand up and down her spine.<br>
<br>
"Couldn't sleep."<br>
<br>
"I told you, you're safe here, Mary." His fingers found the base of her neck and massaged deeply. "Damn, you're tense. You sure you're okay?"<br>
<br>
"I'm fine. Really."<br>
<br>
He stopped the rubbing. "Do you ever answer that question truthfully?"<br>
<br>
"I just did." Sort of.<br>
<br>
His hand resumed the stroking. "Will you promise me something?"<br>
<br>
"What?"<br>
<br>
"Will you let me know when you're not okay?" His voice became teasing. "I mean, I know you're tough, so I won't hold my breath for it or anything. You won't have to worry about killing me over this."<br>
<br>
She laughed. "I promise."<br>
<br>
He tilted her chin up with his finger, eyes grave. "I'm going to keep you to that." Then he dropped a kiss to her cheek. "Listen, I was going to head down to the kitchen and grab something to eat. You want to come with me? The house is quiet. The other brothers are still out."<br>
<br>
"Sure. Let me change."<br>
<br>
"Just put on one of my fleeces." He went over to the dresser and took out something soft, black, and the size of a tarp. "I like the idea of you wearing my clothes."<br>
<br>
As he helped her into it, his smile was a very masculine expression of satisfaction. And possessiveness.<br>
<br>
And damned if it didn't suit his face to a tee.<br>
<br>
By the time they finished eating and were back upstairs in his room, Rhage was having trouble concentrating. The hum was roaring in full force, worse than ever before. And he was totally aroused, his body so hot he felt like his blood was going to dry out in his veins.<br>
<br>
As Mary went over to the bed and settled in, he took a quick shower and wondered if he shouldn't give his erection a release before he came back out. The damn thing was hard, stiff, aching like a bitch, and the water rushing down his body made him think of Mary's hands on his skin. He palmed himself and remembered the feel of her moving against his mouth as he pleasured her soft secrets. He lasted, like, less than a minute.<br>
<br>
When it was over, the empty orgasm just juiced him up more. It was like his body knew the real thing was out in the bedroom and had no intention of being diverted.<br>
<br>
Cursing, he stepped out and toweled off, then headed for his closet. With a prayer for Fritz's attention to detail, he hunted around until he found¡ªthank you, God¡ªa set of pajamas he'd never put on before. He shrugged into them and then threw on the matching robe for good measure.<br>
<br>
Rhage grimaced, feeling like he was wearing half the damn closet. But that was the point.<br>
<br>
"Is the room too warm for you?" he asked, as he willed a candle to light and turned off the lamp.<br>
<br>
"It's perfect."<br>
<br>
Personally, he thought he was in the flipping tropics. And the temperature jacked higher as he approached the bed and sat on the opposite side from her.<br>
<br>
"Listen, Mary, in about an hour, at four forty-five, you're going to hear the shutters closing for the day. They slide down on tracks over the windows. It's not that loud, but I don't want you to be startled."<br>
<br>
"Thanks."<br>
<br>
Rhage lay down on top of the comforter and crossed his feet at the ankles. Everything irritated him, the hot room, the PJs, the robe. Now he knew what presents felt like, all trussed up in paper and ribbons: itchy.<br>
<br>
"Do you normally wear all that to bed?" she asked.<br>
<br>
"Absolutely."<br>
<br>
"Then why's the tag still on that robe?"<br>
<br>
"In case I want another, I'll know what it is."<br>
<br>
He turned on his side, away from her. Rolled back over so he stared at the ceiling again. A minute later, he tried his stomach.<br>
<br>
"Rhage." Her voice was lovely in the dim quiet.<br>
<br>
"What?"<br>
<br>
"You sleep in the nude, right?"<br>
<br>
"Ah, usually."<br>
<br>
"Look, you can lose the clothes. It's not going to bother me."<br>
<br>
"I didn't want you to feel... uncomfortable."<br>
<br>
"What's making me uncomfortable is you flopping around on that side of the bed. I feel like a tossed salad over here."<br>
<br>
He would have chuckled at her reasonable tone, but the hot pump between his legs sucked the humor right out of him.<br>
<br>
Ah, hell, if he thought the getup he had on was going to keep him in check, he was out of his mind. He wanted her so badly that short of chain mail, what he was or was not wearing wasn't going to make a lick of difference.<br>
<br>
Keeping his back to her, he stood up and stripped. With some finessing, he managed to get himself under the covers without flashing her a glimpse of what the front of him was up to. That monstrous arousal was nothing she needed to know about.<br>
<br>
He faced away from her, lying on his side.<br>
<br>
"Can I touch it?" she asked.<br>
<br>
His erection jerked, as if volunteering to be the "it." "Touch what?"<br>
<br>
"The tattoo. I'd like to... touch it."<br>
<br>
God, she was so close to him, and that voice of hers¡ªthat sweet, beautiful voice¡ªwas magic. But the hum in his body made him feel like he had a paint mixer in his belly.<br>
<br>
When he stayed quiet, she murmured, "Never mind. I don't¡ª"<br>
<br>
"No. It's just..." Shit. He hated the distance in her tone. "Mary, it's okay. Do whatever you like."<br>
<br>
He heard sheets brushing against sheets. Felt the mattress move a little. And then her fingertips brushed his shoulder. He kept his flinch to himself as best he could.<br>
<br>
"Where did you get it done?" she whispered, tracing the curse's outline. "The artwork is extraordinary."<br>
<br>
His whole body tensed as he felt precisely where she was on the beast. She was going across its left foreleg now, and he knew it because he felt the corresponding tingle in his own limb.<br>
<br>
Rhage closed his eyes, getting trapped between the pleasure of having her hand on him and the reality that he was flirting with disaster. The vibration, the burning¡ªit was all rising, called out of darkest, most destructive core of him.<br>
<br>
He inhaled through his teeth as she stroked the beast's flank.<br>
<br>
"Your skin is so smooth," she said, running her palm down his spine.<br>
<br>
Frozen in place, unable to breathe, he prayed for self-control.<br>
<br>
"And... well, anyway." She pulled back. "I think it's beautiful."<br>
<br>
He was on top of her before he knew he'd moved. And he wasn't a gentleman. He pushed his thigh between her legs, pinned her arms over her head, and found her mouth with his own. As she arched into him, he grabbed hold of her nightgown and yanked up hard. He was going to take her. At this very moment and in his bed, just as he'd wanted to.<br>
<br>
And she was going to be perfect.<br>
<br>
Her thighs yielded to him, opening wide, and she urged him on, his name a hoarse moan leaving her lips. The sound lit off a violent shaking in him, one that dimmed his vision and sent pulses down his arms and legs. The taking of her consumed him, stripped him of whatever civilized lid there was on his instincts. He was raw, wild and...<br>
<br>
On the verge of the scorching implosion that was the curse's calling card.<br>
<br>
Terror gave him the strength he needed to leap off her and stumble across the room. He slammed into something. The wall.<br>
<br>
"Rhage!"<br>
<br>
Sinking down onto the floor, he put his trembling hands over his face, knowing his eyes were white. His body shook so badly his words came out in waves. "I'm out of my mind... This is... Shit, I can't... I need to stay away from you."<br>
<br>
"Why? I don't want you to stop¡ª"<br>
<br>
He talked right over her. "I'm starved for you, Mary. I'm so damn... hungry, but I can't have you. I won't take... you."<br>
<br>
"Rhage," she snapped, as if trying to get through to him. "Why not?"<br>
<br>
"You don't want me. Trust me, you really don't want me like that."<br>
<br>
"The hell I don't."<br>
<br>
He wasn't about to tell her he was a beast waiting to happen. So he chose to disgust her rather than scare her. "I've had eight different females this week alone."<br>
<br>
There was a long pause. "Good... God."<br>
<br>
"I don't want to lie to you. Ever. So let me be very clear. I've had a lot of anonymous sex. I've been with so many females, none of whom I've cared about. And I don't want you to ever think I'd use you like that."<br>
<br>
Now that his pupils felt as though they were black again, he looked over at her.<br>
<br>
"Tell me you practice safe sex," she muttered.<br>
<br>
"When the females ask me to, I do."<br>
<br>
Her eyes flared. "And when they don't?"<br>
<br>
"I could no more get the common cold from one of them than I could HIV or hep C or any STD. And I'm not a carrier of those diseases, either. Human viruses don't affect us."<br>
<br>
She pulled the sheets up around her shoulders. "How do you know you're not getting them pregnant? Or can't humans and vampires..."<br>
<br>
"Half-breeds are rare, but it does happen. And it's obvious to me when the females are fertile. I can smell it. If they are, or are close, I don't have sex with them, even using protection. My children, when I have them, will be born in safety in my world. And I will love their mother."<br>
<br>
Mary's eyes skipped away, becoming fixed, haunted. He looked up to see what she was staring at. It was the Madonna and Child painting over the dresser.<br>
<br>
"I'm glad you told me," she finally said. "But why does it have to be with strangers? Why can you be with someone you... Actually, don't answer that. It's none of my business."<br>
<br>
"I'd rather be with you, Mary. Not being inside of you is... torture. I want you so badly I can't stand it." He blew out his breath. "But can you honestly tell me that you want me now? Although... hell, even if you did, there's still something else. The way you go to my head, it's like I told you before. I'm scared of losing control. You affect me differently than other females do."<br>
<br>
There was another long silence. She broke it.<br>
<br>
"Tell me again that you're miserable we're not sleeping together," she said dryly.<br>
<br>
"I am utterly miserable. Achy. Hard all the time. Distracted and pissed off."<br>
<br>
"Good." She laughed a little. "Boy, I'm a bitch, aren't I?"<br>
<br>
"Not at all."<br>
<br>
The room grew quiet. Eventually he lay down and curled onto his side, resting his head on his arm.<br>
<br>
She sighed. "I don't expect you to sleep on the floor now."<br>
<br>
"It's better this way."<br>
<br>
"For chrissakes, Rhage, get up here."<br>
<br>
His voice dropped to a low growl. "If I come back to that bed, there's no way I'm not going for that sweet spot between your legs. And it wouldn't be just my hands and my tongue this time. It would be right back to where we were. My body on top of yours, every thick inch of me desperate to get into you."<br>
<br>
As he caught the luscious scent of her arousal, the air between them surged with sex. And inside his body, he turned back into a live wire.<br>
<br>
"Mary, I'd better go. I'll come back after you're asleep."<br>
<br>
He left before she could utter another word. As the door shut behind him, he sagged against the wall in the corridor. Being out of the room helped. It was harder to catch her scent that way.<br>
<br>
He heard a laugh and looked over to see Phury sauntering down the corridor.<br>
<br>
"You look strung out, Hollywood. As well as really goddamned naked."<br>
<br>
Rhage covered himself with his hands. "I don't know how you can take it."<br>
<br>
The brother stopped, swirling the mug of hot cider he carried. "Take what?"<br>
<br>
"The celibacy."<br>
<br>
"Don't tell me your female won't have you?"<br>
<br>
"That's not the problem."<br>
<br>
"So why you out in this hall standing at full attention?"<br>
<br>
"I, ah, don't want to hurt her."<br>
<br>
Phury looked taken aback. "You're a big one, but you've never injured a female. At least not that I've known."<br>
<br>
"No, it's just... I want her so badly, I'm... I'm juiced, man."<br>
<br>
Phury's yellow eyes narrowed. "You talking about your beast?"<br>
<br>
Rhage looked away. "Yeah."<br>
<br>
The whistle that came out of the brother was grim. "Well... hell, you'd better take care of yourself. You want to pay her respect, that's fine. But you keep yourself on the level or you're really going to hurt her, you feel me? Find a fight, find some other females if you have to, but you make sure you're calm. And if you need some red smoke, you come to me. I'll give you some of my O-Zs, no problem."<br>
<br>
Rhage took a deep breath. "I'll pass on the smokes right now. But can I borrow some sweats and a pair of Nikes? I'm going to try to run myself into exhaustion."<br>
<br>
Phury clapped him on the back. "Come on, my brother. I'm more than happy to cover your ass."</p>							<!-- Composite Start -->
